# User Experience - A Cheatsheet

User experience is exactly what it sounds like - the experience of the people who interact with your code. The term "experience" covers every aspect of that interaction. Think of the last time you went out to a restaurant; your experience included the resaurant's exterior and signage, the lighting and ambient music/noise, bathroom cleanliness, waitstaff attentiveness, time spent waiting for food, order accuracy, price, and the quality of the dishes themselves. Chances are, someone working at your favorite restaurant has taken all these things into consideration to deliver the best experience possible.

In the web development world, user experience includes things like how quickly a page loads, how easy it is to find desired information, visual appeal, browser responsiveness, accessibility concerns, and whether your app is fun or engaging overall. No matter how well your code runs, if a user doesn't enjoy interacting with it, you've failed that user. Great UX is equal parts head and heart, including both solid working code and an empathetic understanding of how the code will be used.

### The Two UX Commandments

There are two cardinal rules for user experience:
1) Know your user.
2) Remember that you're not your user.

Knowing your user means doing research into their desires, requirements, environment and habits and understanding their wants and needs as if they were your own. 

But no matter how well you think you identify with your users, they will never know as much about your code as you do, which puts you at a design disadvantage. You must push yourself to question all your assumptions about what they know and how they want to interact with your code. 

Even as you exercise empathy and ask yourself, "If I were the end user, how would I respond to this feature?" you can't *really* believe you're the end user; if you do, you'll probably end up making a product designed more for you than for anyone else. And you'll likely end up resenting negative feedback from your users instead of learning from what they're trying to tell you.

### Getting Started - Requirements

Start your design process by asking a ton of questions about what your users need. Knowing *why* you're making something will help you decide *how* to make it. There are a few different types of requirements to consider. 

Business - If your user is a company, you'll want to ask about how they plan to monetize the product, how they'll be using it to interact with vendors or clients, and how they expect the product to help them reach their business goals. As a noted philosopher once said, "if you're playing with my money, you're playing with my emotions." So handle these questions first if they apply to your project.

Design - You might be entering a space with existing design requirements, or a need to revamp a tired design. Find out what the design expectations are and whether there are any hard restrictions or must-have design features.

Technology - If your code won't run on your client's computer...well, let's just make sure it does. Learn the ins and outs of your users' technology needs and restrictions. Must you use a certain type of database structure? Is a deployment method unusable for your project? What languages will you need to use?

Users - Who is your audience? How will they use your product? Do they have any existing habits or preferences that will inform their expectations? You'll find yourself coming back to your user requirements as you make design decisions later on. In fact, this set of questions is so important, it deserves its own section...

### Diving Deeper - User Analysis

This is where you need to be like a detective on Criminal Minds. Your user might not be a notorious serial killer (no judgements!) but you still need to get into their head. Ask yourself the following questions about your users, and as many more as you can think of:

* What are their demographics?
* Where do they live?
* Where do they work?
* What difficulties do they face in their lives?
* What are their hobbies?
* When would they use your product?
* *Why* would they use your product?
* Do they present any accessibility concerns?
* How long will they use your product in one session?

You'll also want to ask yourself, "What is the main thing a user will be doing with my app?" On Facebook, it might be liking and sharing content. On Amazon, it might be buying an item. On your site, your goal will be to isolate the main task and organize your entire UX around it. Who cares how slick your photo app's sign-in popup looks if browsing photos is cumbersome? Focus your attention on the central task your users will be performing, and work outward from there. Ask:

* How can I teach users how to perform the task?
* How might users screw up completing the task? 
* What edge cases might users run into? 
* What errors might users encounter?
* Will users try performing the task in different ways? Will different methods have to work?

### Design Flow - From Scribbles to Substance

Your users won't care about what's under the hood. They'll care about what they're actually interacting with, what they're seeing, what they're clicking on. To design those things, you'll need to think visually. It helps to draw things out.

Start with sketches of your ideas and work from there. Once you've brainstormed some things you like, formalize them by building a basic wireframe. Then write some HTML/CSS to mimic the look and functionality of your design.

As you navigate through your rough app, imagine you're the user. What buttons don't make sense? What looks vague, unwieldy, or just plain gross? Are there moments where you wish you could navigate to a specific page from where you're at, but you can't? Be brutal. No one likes your code as much as you do. If part of your look or experience is annoying or weird to you, think of how it comes across to someone who *didn't* slave over it for hours. Remember: you are not your user.

### Rubber, Meet Road - User Feedback

At this point, you've thought through the needs of your client, analyzed your target users, defined the purpose of your application, and worked through several design iterations. The only thing missing is the most important thing of all - the actual user's experience! Find someone who hasn't seen your product before, put it in front of them, and listen to what they have to say about it. Can they get it working? Are they confused about where to go or what to do? Does the look turn them off? Are they spending too much time doing things other than the central task you're trying to help them do?

This is where humility and empathy are crucial. If you can't take feedback, you'll crash and burn here. If you've spent a ton of time on a feature that no one cares about or uses, you might need to lose it. If you left some clutter off a nav bar and users are clamoring for those links, you'll need to find a less-cluttery way to bring them back somehow. It can be hard to take user feedback when it goes against your initial vision, but you need to care more about your users than your vision if you want to be great at UX. And, as you get great at UX, your vision will naturally evolve to be closer to what your users need anyway.

There are resources, like verifyapp.com and usabilla.com that can put your work in front of many users and return stats about how people use the app you've built. They cost money, but can save you much more in the long run by helping you fix big problems before they become hopelessly enmeshed with other elements of your app. Actionable, trackable feedback is an invaluable tool in your arsenal if you want to make great content that your users will love to use.

### Experience Excellence

If it's worth using, it's worth UX design. A minimum viable product that users don't want to use is not minimally viable. That restaurant you like is doing more than making a yummy dish and setting it on the sidewalk. The food is only one piece of the big picture. Consider your user, build around their wants and needs, and plan each step of their experience, and you'll build something that people will love to use. Beautiful and meaningful. THe way things ought to be.
