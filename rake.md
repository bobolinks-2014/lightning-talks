# rake! 

We use rake everyday, but do we really, truly KNOW rake? 

## Default rake tasks

There are a LOT. You've been warned...


```

```

Many of these will be familiar to you, but there are several new ones we know very little about. 

Let's explore some new tasks: 

###rake notes

The Rails description for rake notes:

```rake notes                                          # Enumerate all annotations (use notes:optimize, :fixme, :todo for focus)```

There are three default notes that are built into Rails apps: OPTIMIZE, FIXME and TODO. 

Note: They need to be in upcase in the code, but downcase in the terminal.

Here's a method that needs some work

```Ruby
# TODO: look for more efficient way to do this
def format_date
	date = self.created_at
	[date.month, date.day, date.year].join(".")
end
```

Let's find a list of notes tagged with 'TODO'?

```
$ rake notes:todo
app/models/post.rb:
  * [5] look for more efficient way to do this
```

What if we wanted to create our own notes? 

```rake notes:custom                                   # Enumerate a custom annotation, specify with ANNOTATION=CUSTOM```

```Ruby
# BOBO: may need some refactoring (tweet, tweet)
def full_name
	"Mr. Bobo, the Link"
end
```

Let's run a search for notes tagged with 'BOBO':

```
$ rake notes:custom ANNOTATION=BOBO
app/models/user.rb:
  * [16] may need some refactoring
```

Now let's run a search for all notes:

```
$ rake notes
app/controllers/posts_controller.rb:
  * [7] [FIXME] need to fix redirect_to

app/models/post.rb:
  * [5] [TODO] look for more efficient way to do this
 ```

This will not return results for custom notes. If you'd like to include them, you'll need to redefine rake routes to add your own custom tag. Check out the Codemancers resources link for step-by-step instructions on how to do this. 

Also note the following: 

>By default, rake notes will look in the app, config, lib, bin and test directories. If you would like to search other directories, you can provide them as a comma separated list in an environment variable SOURCE_ANNOTATION_DIRECTORIES.  - RailsGuides

###rake assets:precompile

Have you ever deployed to Heroku and wondered, 'Where the heck is my CSS?'

Rails comes with a rake task to compile the assets. By default, compiled assets are written to the /assets directory.  

>You can call this task on the server during deployment to create compiled versions of your assets directly on the server.  - RailsGuides

Here's what you probably missed: 

```$ RAILS_ENV=production bin/rake assets:precompile```

For more info on the asset pipeline, check out the RailsGuide resources link. 


###custom rake tasks

If you want something fancy, you can even build your own rake task.

Let's try adding everyone's favorite rake command: `rake db:yolo`

Rails was kind enough to give us a generator for creating new tasks.

```Ruby
$ rails g task bobo yolo
      create  lib/tasks/bobo.rake
```

Here's what our new `bobo.rake` file contains:

```Ruby
namespace :bobo do
  desc "TODO"
  task yolo: :environment do
  end
end
```

We'll need to make a couple changes for our `bobo:yolo`

```Ruby
namespace :bobo do
  desc "drop, create, migrate bobo's database"
  task yolo: [:environment,'db:drop', 'db:create', 'db:migrate']
end
```

Let's try it out:

```
$ rake bobo:yolo
== 20140825014830 CreateUsers: migrating ======================================
-- create_table(:users)
   -> 0.0081s
== 20140825014830 CreateUsers: migrated (0.0083s) =============================

== 20140825014902 CreatePosts: migrating ======================================
-- create_table(:posts)
   -> 0.0215s
== 20140825014902 CreatePosts: migrated (0.0218s) =============================

```

Hooray!
